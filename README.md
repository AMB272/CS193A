All the materials are available on their site, but not downloadable due to login requirements (However, lecture code is downloadable). DO CHECK OUT THEIR SITE.(And say thanks to the professor who works hard for this course by leaving a comment on youtube - not me) (oh and dont blame me if 2/3 years later you find this outdated, btw)
